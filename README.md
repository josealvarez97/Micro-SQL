# Micro-SQL

A prototype of a Database Management System (DBMS) that allows to manage data structures on a personalized fashion, also allowing the use of several languages besides english. 

Posed as a university level project at [Rafael Landivar University](http://principal.url.edu.gt/) for the Data Structures course during the Spring of 2017. You may refer to the [official the project guidelines and requirements](../master/Proyecto%20ED1%20Final.pdf) (Spanish) for details on what the applications does. 

An important part of this project was developing a library of classes (a .dll file on the solution of this repository). For taking a look at the data structures, refer to [here](https://github.com/josealvarez97/Estructura-de-Datos-1-Lab/tree/master/Lab%203/DataStructuresURL_3.0) (it's a link to another school work repository, a bit messy, so the reader may focus to the section in the link). Checking out the [Binary Tree class](https://github.com/josealvarez97/Estructura-de-Datos-1-Lab/blob/master/Lab%203/DataStructuresURL_3.0/DataStructuresURL_3.0/BTree.cs) is specially recommeneded (it also has informative comments).
